LABTASKS.md

Probably, once you have gotten to the point of reading these lab tasks (instructions), you will have your remote repository set up on GitHub (since we are using GitHub Classroom and you followed the assignment invitation to get started on the lab). The outcomes for this lab are included in the [README](README.md)

The starter code in this repository includes two test files. Running the test file and having all the tests pass is a good indication that you have made your code work correctly.
