   * Quote from chapter 11 (as stated in a comment response on a stackoverflow page here): 
   * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/285793/what-is-a-serialversionuid-and-why-should-i-use-it
   * "Regardless of what serialized form you choose, declare an explicit 
   * serial version UID in every serializable class you write. This eliminates the serial version 
   * UID as a potential source of incompatibility (Item 74). There is also a small performance 
   * benefit. If no serial version UID is provided, an expensive computation is required to 
   * generate one at runtime."
