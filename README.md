# Lab - Integer List

## Exploration of JUnit, Interfaces, and Exceptions using Integer List

This code was created for use in CSci 2101: Data Structures at the University of Minnesota Morris. By the end of this lab, you should meet these learning outcomes:

1. Understand the basic structure and function of unit tests in Java (JUnit 5)
   1. How can you write a test in JUnit?
   2. What are the minimal requirements for JUnit to see your code as a test and for the test to provide meaning?
2. Understand the benefits of using an interface to define the expected behavior of an object (in this case, an integer list that could be implemented as a linked list or an array)
   1. How might this all look different without an interface?
   2. How can the interface help you with writing tests?
3. Understand and use exceptions to indicate behavior that is unsupported (and testing for exceptions by triggering those behaviors)

The [instructions for this lab](LABTASKS.md) are written in a markdown file.
